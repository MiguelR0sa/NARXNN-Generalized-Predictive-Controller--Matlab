# NARXNN-Generalized-Predictive-Controller--Matlab

This work constitutes an implementation of a GPC, Generalized predictive controller in matlab using a pre trained NARXNN model, which is also used for process simulation.G
GPC is a control algorithm that defines a cost function representing the error caused by an hypothetical input sequence realtive to a predetermined trajectory. The ideal input is then calculated as a non linear optimization problem.

The script allows the user to see the evoltuion of the simulation in real time.

This controller proved capable of controlling the outputs of the simulated system.
